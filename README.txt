# Note from A_MilkyWay

Only the people who can script are allowed to move cards. To create a request or idea, create a card in the `Ideas / Requests`. Depending on the type of script, copy the description of the `Templates and Description` and paste it in your card. After you did that, modify it to fit your request. After all that, if some scripter really likes that idea, then they will move it into `Pending`. Whenever someone is ready to start, they should move it into `In Progress`. (When you add it to `In Progress` please add a Label with your name). The last 3 lists should make sense based off their names.
