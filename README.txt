# Note from A_MilkyWay

Only the people who can script are allowed to move cards, as if you can not, you will not need to. To create a request or idea, create a card in the `Ideas / Requests`. Depending on the type of script, copy the description of the `Templates and Description` and paste it in your card. After you did that, modify it to fit your request. Next, if someone really likes that idea, then they will move it into `Pending`. Whenever someone is ready to start working on it, they should move it into `In Progress`. (When you add it to `In Progress` please add a Label with your name, If it does not exist then create it). The last 3 lists should make sense based off their names.
